	<h3>Volunteering: September 6th, 2021</h3>

		<p>On Labor Day, our company had the day off and we decided as a company 
		to help around the Indianola community. All the opportunities we had were
		endless:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Mowed Lawns</li>
			<li>Cleaned Cars</li>
			<li>Visit Local Restaurants</li>
			<li>Go to the homeless shelter</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We love volunteering within our community to those who have always
		supported our company from the beginning to now.</p>
